# MuseGAN
Generative Neural Network training and evaluation for 
Blues/Jass multitrack MIDIes generation

## Notice:
This project currently remains in a draft-version and not being 
developed further

## File structure:

```
./Blues/    # Folder containing collected Blues MIDIes
./Jazz/     # Folder containing collected Jazz MIDIes

autumn5[1].mid    # One of the best generated examples
main.py           # Script for MIDI-parsing, meta-information extraction
midies_df         # Dataframe containing MIDIes and parsed information

SymNet_inference.ipynb    # Notebook specifically designed for Google collab use
                          # responsible for model evaluation
